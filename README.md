## 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Model

A Machine Learning project to predict the quality of wine using physicochemical properties. The model analyzes features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and other chemical attributes to estimate the wine’s quality. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources to:

- 📊 Load and preprocess the **Wine Quality Dataset**
- 🧪 Train Machine Learning models to predict wine quality
- 🧠 Evaluate and compare model performance

The goal is to build a reliable ML model that can classify wine quality based on various chemical indicators. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📁 Dataset

We used the **Wine Quality Dataset** that includes samples of red and white wines, with features like:

- Fixed Acidity  
- Volatile Acidity  
- Citric Acid  
- Residual Sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (target label) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

✔️ The dataset is sourced from public repositories and widely used for ML benchmarking. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
